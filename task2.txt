- Account Create & Setup
- Remote --> It is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes.

- Branch --> it just shows the branches working locally.


- Clone --> creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotedly. The clone includes all the project files, history and branches.

- Commit --> It's like taking a photo. anything that's been staged with "git" add will become a part of the snapshot with "git commit".

- Push --> updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch.

- Pull --> it updates the changes made by the other teammate who has commits to the branch on a remote and later would like to review changes locally.
